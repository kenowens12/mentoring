##### Refactor the APIs for better readability and less maintenance overhead

- Description: Currently the HTTP API is not very well organized and needs some tidying up. The actual course of action is not decided yet, but [go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit) looks like a good fit.

### Proposed Project ideas

### Kubernetes

#### Kubernetes working group for CSI driver

-	Description: Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a standard for exposing storage systems to containerized workloads on Kubernetes. The idea is to implement a few new CSI features and also e2e tests to cover those features, e.g. volume expansion, Windows support, inline volume support etc. Also, there are requirements to rewrite some flexvolume drivers(e.g. [smb driver](https://github.com/Azure/kubernetes-volume-drivers/tree/master/flexvolume/smb)) to CSI driver.
-	Recommended Skills: golang, Kubernetes
